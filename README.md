# Employee Tracker

## Description

This project was created to provide business owners with an easy way to view and manage the company's employees, roles, and departments.

## Installation

Navigate to my [GitHub page](https://github.com/jnc444xd/employee-tracker) to clone the code to your local machine. Navigate to the downloaded application's folder using terminal, then install necessary npm packages (inquirer, mysql2) using the following commands: "npm i inquirer@8.2.4" and "npm i mysql2". Use the schema.sql file inside the db folder to create a database with tables for employees, roles, and departments. Then seed these tables with user's company info. 

## Usage

Here is a [video](https://watch.screencastify.com/v/aT0fS6MtiUCDUXiFnSE9) demonstrating how to use this application.

Initialize the application inside terminal by entering this command: "npm start". Once initialized, user will be presented with a series of prompts to view/manage their company's database.
